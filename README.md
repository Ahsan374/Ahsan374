Hi, I am Ahsan Hayat, a Physics Student from Pakistan. I have a Master's Degree in Physics with a research focus on Mathematical Physics(Geometrical Quantum Mechanics).
Currently, I am pursuing a career in Experimental High Energy Physics. I worked at CERN as a support scientist for Beamline for Schools, where I participated in the calibration
and qualification of particle detectors, such as SiPM, Delay Wire Chambers, Scintillation Counters, and calorimeters. These are the primary detectors used in the beamline experiments
such as T10 at CERN. To run a particle physics experiment, we need the Trigger and Data Acquisition system, which logically records the data from these detectors.
The Trigger and Data Acquisition System contains modules like Discrimators, Coincident Module, Delay Lines, Fan in/Fan out, High Voltage Suppliers, Time-to-Digital Converters(TDC), Charge-to-Digital Converters(QDC),
and single-board computers. To calibrate and Qualify the detectors we used our NIM-Module Based Trigger and Data Acquisition System. To record and monitor the data, we used Linux-based ATLAS Monitoring Software.
Currently, I am working on the analysis of the data acquired during the September 2023 beamtime at T10, Proton Synchrotron, using ROOT and Python. You can access the analysis code here.
Also, after completing the analysis, I am planning to simulate the experiment in Geant4 and compare my analysis results with Geant4 Simulation. For this purpose, I am collaborating with a team of scientists at CERN.
